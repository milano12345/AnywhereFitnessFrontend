# Anywhere Fitness Frontend

My name is Daniel Milano and this is one of my solo projects, a Full-Stack React app currently called Anywhere Fitness.

The technologies I'm using for this project:

Front End:
HTML5, CSS3, Styled Components, Javascript, React, React-router, Netlify

Backend: 
Node, Express, Bcrypt, JWT, Knex, SQLite3, Next, Heroku

Clients and Instructors have the ability to register accounts. 
Instructors can create, edit, and delete their currently available classes.
Clients are presented with a gorgeous experience, as they are able to view a nicely designed calendar that displays our up-to-date fitness classes! 
Clients have the ability to opt in to any class that has available spots!

More features to come!
